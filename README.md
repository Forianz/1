# Animated GIFs on Adafruit RGB LED Matrix with Raspberry Pi

This tutorial explains how to display an animated gif on an Adafruit RGB LED Matrix panel using a Raspberry Pi microcontroller. 

I used my matrix to display a spooky ghost gif for Halloween. :jack_o_lantern:

The video in the following tweet shows the final result:

* USB mouse and keyboard 
* HDMI display and cable

  (Youâ€™ll need these last two items to interface with your Raspberry Pi the first time you log in. Later, you can set up SSH to access your Raspberry Pi remotely.)

## SOFTWARE
* Aesprite: animated sprite editor & pixel art tool $14.99

  https://www.aseprite.org/
  
  (Or some other program for creating 32x32 animated gif.)

* Nano, a simple command line editor

  (Comes pre-installed on Raspbian OS)
  
  http://www.tutorialspoint.com/articles/how-to-use-nano-text-editor
  
  (Or some other code editor, such as Sublime Text.)

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Prepare your Raspberry Pi**


  1. Follow Adafruitâ€™s instructions for getting Raspbian OS running on your Raspberry Pi.
  
    https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-raspberry-pi-lesson-1-preparing-and-sd-card-for-your-raspberry-pi
    

  2. Connect your Raspberry Pi to the Internet.
    
    https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-3-network-setup/overview 
    
    
  3. Set Up SSH for Remote Connection. (Optional)
  
    With an SSH connection, you can log in to your Raspberry Pi remotely (from your regular computer). Youâ€™ll no longer need the HDMI monitor and USB mouse/keyboard connected to your Raspberry Pi.
  
    https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/
    

  4. Set Up Remote Code Editing with Sublime Text. (Optional)
  		
	https://github.com/poemusica/rpi-matrix-gif/blob/master/UsingRsub.md
	
	Alternatively, you can ignore this step altogether and just use Nano to write and edit code. Nano is a simple command line text editor that comes preinstalled on Raspbian OS.

2. **Assemble the HAT**

  Donâ€™t be intimidated! This project was my first time soldering. I was able to do it, and you can do it too. :smile:

  Adafruit has a great tutorial about how to solder the components of the RGB Matrix HAT:
  
  https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rgb-matrix-plus-real-time-clock-hat-for-raspberry-pi/assembly

  If youâ€™re new to soldering, see also Adafruitâ€™s Guide to Excellent Soldering:
  
  https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering
  

3. **Activate the Matrix**
  
  Follow Adafruitâ€™s instructions for connecting the hardware, installing PIL (Python Image Library), and downloading/running their demo code.
  
  https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rgb-matrix-plus-real-time-clock-hat-for-raspberry-pi/driving-matrices
  
  When you have the Adafruit demos working, youâ€™re ready to start creating designs of your own!


4. **Display Pixel Art Animations**


  1. Make a 32x32 pixel art animation using Aesprite (or some other software) and export it as a .gif.
  
    https://www.aseprite.org/

    Youâ€™ll probably want to do this step on your regular computer.
    

  2. Copy your animated gif onto your Raspberry Pi.
  
    On your regular computer, open a new terminal and type:
	
    `scp <source> pi@<pi_ip>:<destination>`

    where `<source>` is the path to the file you want to copy, `<pi_ip>` is your Raspberry Piâ€™s IP address, and `<destination>` the path to this project directory on your Raspberry Pi.
    

  3. Run the displayGIF script to display your animation.
     
     On the Raspberry Pi or in your SSH terminal, type:

    `python displayGIF.py`
  
    By default, the script displays the included sample gif created by @jettisonjoe. (Thanks Joe!) ![Ghost] (https://github.com/poemusica/rpi-matrix-gif/blob/master/myGIF.gif)
  
    To display your own gif, simply replace `myGIF` in the code with the name of your gif.

    Use `Ctrl-C` in the command line to stop the script.
    

5. **Run on boot (Optional)**

  If you want the displayGIF script to run automatically whenever you start up the Raspberry Pi, follow these instructions to edit the `rc.local` file on your Raspberry Pi:
  
  https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/rc-local.md
